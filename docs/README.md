Planned architecture:

- PAAS (CloudFoundry, OpenShift) vs IAAS (AWS, Linode)
- DBAAS (mongolab vs mongohq)
- CDN (MaxCDN)
- External user login (Google+, Yahoo!, etc)
- Build (Gradle vs Maven)
- Deployment/continuous-delivery
-- Spindle Otto vs LiveRebel vs Git-push-to-PAAS
- UI framework (Groundwork, Foundation, Bootstrap)
- Spring
-- Java 7 vs OpenJDK 8

Issues:

- where/how to store user images?
