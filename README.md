Social platform for education services

We're improving education by helping homeschool parents:

- Create and manage their own lesson plans
- Share, find, and use lesson plans created by other homeschooling parents
- Track student work and progress
- Keep a log of days completed for the school year
- Share questions, advice, and experiences with other homeschoolers
- Focus less on administration and more on teaching and growing young minds

Your investment in your children's education is important.

[edify.io](http://edify.io) aims to make your job as a parent *and teacher* easier, so you can
tackle homeschooling with confidence and convenience.

Let's edify the next generation!
